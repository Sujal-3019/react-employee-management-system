<h1 align="center">👨‍💼 Employee Management System</h1>

## ✨ About the Project

The **Employee Management System** is a real-world web app built using **React.js** and **LocalStorage** designed for productivity and simplicity.  
It enables an **Admin** to manage employees, assign tasks, monitor progress, and maintain control—all from a clean, intuitive dashboard.  
Employees can log in, view, accept, complete, or fail tasks in real-time.  

🧠 This project showcases state management, CRUD operations, authentication-like flow, and data persistence without a backend.
